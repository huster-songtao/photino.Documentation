# Frequently Asked Questions

* **Does Photino support native controls?** No. Photino uses modern browser controls and supports pretty much everything supported in a WebKit or Chromium web browser, but native controls are not a priority for Photino at this point. This may change as MAUI gets close to release and offers more opportunity for native control support.
*  **Does Photino run on mobile devices?** No. Photino runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. While we'd like to add mobile support in the future and it is on our roadmap to evaluate, there is no current work being done in this area. 
* **How does Photino compare to Blazor Desktop?** Blazor's desktop direction appears to be focused on the evolution of MAUI (Xamarin Forms vNext) to support not only desktop, but also mobile platforms and support for native controls. While this promises to be a viable path for Blazor apps, it's not clear how much support there will be for non-Blazor HTML-based apps (what's now referred to as Hybrid apps). Photino's focus is to enable HTML-based UIs on the desktop.
*  **I'm getting a "Could not find 'xxxxxx' in 'window'" error when I run my Photino app** All content files you want to include in your build and distribution should be set to 'copy if newer' or 'copy always' in Visual Studio. This includes all files in the wwwroot folder and often 3rd part files in the _content folder. Visual Studio does not automatically mark all files found in these folders to be copied during the build.
